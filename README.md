# PROJECT: Retail Marketing EDA and Data Preprocessing

## Domain: Marketing, Retail

### Learning Outcome: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization

### Context:
Marketing analytics is the study of data gathered through marketing campaigns in order to analyse patterns between such things as how a campaign contributed to conversions, consumer behaviour, regional preferences, creative preferences and much more. The goal of marketing analytics as a practice is to use these patterns and findings to optimize future campaigns based on what was successful. Marketing analytics benefits both marketers and consumers. This analysis allows marketers to achieve higher return of investment on marketing investments by understanding what is successful in driving conversions, brand awareness and improvement related to sales, inventory, targeting customers, and other important crucial aspects.
